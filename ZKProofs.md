# Introduction
Blockchain technologies are on the rise as the amount of instructions and calculations we are able to execute on processers in a small amount of time grows continuously. The most famous example of this technology in use today is cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin. In 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto was coming up with the idea for Bitcoin, he ran into the problem regarding security since blockchains are typically open to the public and decentralized. This is great, however what if we want to use the blockchain but keep some pieces of the transaction private, like in an election for instance? This is where zero-knowledge proofs may play a critical role.

# How do Zero Knowledge Proofs Work?
There are two examples that I think really stand out on how zero knowledge proofs work. The first, which can be seen in the 2018 talk given by Elad Verbin at the Web3 Summit (1), is the Find Waldo experiment. Let's say I want to prove to you that Waldo is on the page in a Find Waldo book. I want you to be able to verify that Waldo is indeed on the page without revealing _where_ on the page he is. The best way for me to do this would be to go behind a big screen or something to where you cannot see me or the position the book is in. But I can show you the cut out of Waldo on the page, you just don't know where he is relative on the page. 

Another great example was given by Zooko Wilcox of Zcash during a presentation. In this example, two different bits, a 0 and 1. Now, the party that does not know the bits will know if they switch the bits or not since they are the one physically switching them. 

# Applications for Zero Knowledge Proofs
## Elections and Voting
I think one of the most promising and applicable tasks blockchains with zero knowledge proofs could be applied to is elections and voting. Whether it be on the local or national scale. It seems like this option would allow a faster voting process, which would allow for more frequent voting among all citizens, as well as more secure and trusting elections. If everyone can verify that the votes tally up the way they are supposed to there can be no disputes like we have seen recently in our political atmosphere. Zero knowledge proofs would allow citizens votes to still remain anonymous but still be counted and verified.
